# GRAYLOG CONFIGURATION FILE
############################
#
# This is the Graylog configuration file. The file has to use ISO 8859-1/Latin-1 character encoding.
# Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using Unicode escapes
# as defined in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.3, using the \u prefix.
# For example, \u002c.
#
# * Entries are generally expected to be a single line of the form, one of the following:
#
# propertyName=propertyValue
# propertyName:propertyValue
#
# * White space that appears between the property name and property value is ignored,
#   so the following are equivalent:
#
# name=Stephen
# name = Stephen
#
# * White space at the beginning of the line is also ignored.
#
# * Lines that start with the comment characters ! or # are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored.
#
# * The property value is generally terminated by the end of the line. White space following the
#   property value is not ignored, and is treated as part of the property value.
#
# * A property value can span several lines if each line is terminated by a backslash (‘\’) character.
#   For example:
#
# targetCities=\
#         Detroit,\
#         Chicago,\
#         Los Angeles
#
#   This is equivalent to targetCities=Detroit,Chicago,Los Angeles (white space at the beginning of lines is ignored).
#
# * The characters newline, carriage return, and tab can be inserted with characters \n, \r, and \t, respectively.
#
# * The backslash character must be escaped as a double backslash. For example:
#
# path=c:\\docs\\doc1

# HTTP settings
###############

#### HTTP bind address
#
# The network interface used by the Graylog HTTP interface.
#
# This network interface must be accessible by all Graylog nodes in the cluster and by all clients
# using the Graylog web interface.
#
# If the port is omitted, Graylog will use port 9000 by default.
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1:9000
#http_bind_address = 127.0.0.1:9000
#http_bind_address = [2001:db8::1]:9000

#### HTTP publish URI
#
# The HTTP URI of this Graylog node which is used to communicate with the other Graylog nodes in the cluster and by all
# clients using the Graylog web interface.
#
# The URI will be published in the cluster discovery APIs, so that other Graylog nodes will be able to find and connect to this Graylog node.
#
# This configuration setting has to be used if this Graylog node is available on another network interface than $http_bind_address,
# for example if the machine has multiple network interfaces or is behind a NAT gateway.
#
# If $http_bind_address contains a wildcard IPv4 address (0.0.0.0), the first non-loopback IPv4 address of this machine will be used.
# This configuration setting *must not* contain a wildcard address!

#### External Graylog URI
#
# The public URI of Graylog which will be used by the Graylog web interface to communicate with the Graylog REST API.
#
# The external Graylog URI usually has to be specified, if Graylog is running behind a reverse proxy or load-balancer
# and it will be used to generate URLs addressing entities in the Graylog REST API (see $http_bind_address).
#
# When using Graylog Collector, this URI will be used to receive heartbeat messages and must be accessible for all collectors.
