<a name="List-current-running-Containers"></a>
## List current running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
You can also use the following command if you want to see only this project containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```






<br/>
<a name="Close-all-running-Containers"></a>
## Close all running Containers
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

To stop single container do:

```bash
docker-compose stop {container-name}
```






<br/>
<a name="Delete-all-existing-Containers"></a>
## Delete all existing Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
```






<br/>
<a name="Enter-Container"></a>
## Enter a Container

> Run commands in a running Container.

1 - First list the currently running containers with `docker ps`

2 - Enter any container using:

```bash
docker-compose exec {container-name} bash
```

*Example: enter MySQL container*

```bash
docker-compose exec mysql bash
```

*Example: enter to MySQL prompt within MySQL container*

```bash
docker-compose exec mysql mysql -udefault -psecret
```

3 - To exit a container, type `exit`.






<br/>
<a name="Edit-Container"></a>
## Edit default Container config

Open the `docker-compose.yml` and change anything you want.

Examples:

Change MySQL Database Name:

```yml
    environment:
        MYSQL_DATABASE: laradock
    ...
```

Change Redis default port to 1111:

```yml
    ports:
        - "1111:6379"
    ...
```






<br/>
<a name="Edit-a-Docker-Image"></a>
## Edit a Docker Image

1 - Find the `Dockerfile` of the image you want to edit,
<br/>
example for `mysql` it will be `mysql/Dockerfile`.

2 - Edit the file the way you want.

3 - Re-build the container:

```bash
docker-compose build mysql
```
More info on Containers rebuilding [here](#Build-Re-build-Containers).







<br/>
<a name="Build-Re-build-Containers"></a>
## Build/Re-build Containers

If you do any change to any `Dockerfile` make sure you run this command, for the changes to take effect:

```bash
docker-compose build
```
Optionally you can specify which container to rebuild (instead of rebuilding all the containers):

```bash
docker-compose build {container-name}
```

You might use the `--no-cache` option if you want full rebuilding (`docker-compose build --no-cache {container-name}`).






<br/>
<a name="Add-Docker-Images"></a>
## Add more Docker Images

To add an image (software), just edit the `docker-compose.yml` and add your container details, to do so you need to be familiar with the [docker compose file syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).






<br/>
<a name="View-the-Log-files"></a>
## View the Log files
The NGINX Log file is stored in the `logs/nginx` directory.

However to view the logs of all the other containers (MySQL, PHP-FPM,...) you can run this:

```bash
docker-compose logs {container-name}
```

```bash
docker-compose logs -f {container-name}
```

More [options](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/)






<br/>

<a name="PHP"></a>






<a name="Install-PHP-Extensions"></a>
## Install PHP Extensions

You can set extensions to install in the .env file's corresponding section (`PHP_FPM`, `WORKSPACE`, `PHP_WORKER`), 
just change the `false` to `true` at the desired extension's line.
After this you have to rebuild the container with the `--no-cache` option.

```bash
docker build --no-cache {container-name}
```







<br/>

<a name="Change-the-PHP-FPM-Version"></a>
## Change the (PHP-FPM) Version

By default, the latest stable PHP version is configured to run.

>The PHP-FPM is responsible for serving your application code, you don't have to change the PHP-CLI version if you are planning to run your application on different PHP-FPM version.


### A) Switch from PHP `7.2` to PHP `5.6`

1 - Open the `.env`.

2 - Search for `PHP_VERSION`.

3 - Set the desired version number:

```dotenv
PHP_VERSION=5.6
```

4 - Finally rebuild the image

```bash
docker-compose build php-fpm
```

> For more details about the PHP base image, visit the [official PHP docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).






<br/>
<a name="Change-the-PHP-CLI-Version"></a>
## Change the PHP-CLI Version

>Note: it's not very essential to edit the PHP-CLI version. The PHP-CLI is only used for the Artisan Commands & Composer. It doesn't serve your Application code, this is the PHP-FPM job.

The PHP-CLI is installed in the Workspace container. To change the PHP-CLI version you need to simply change the `PHP_VERSION` in the .env file as follow:

1 - Open the `.env`.

2 - Search for `PHP_VERSION`.

3 - Set the desired version number:

```dotenv
PHP_VERSION=7.2
```

4 - Finally rebuild the image

```bash
docker-compose build workspace
```

<a name="Install-xDebug"></a>
## Install xDebug

1 - First install `xDebug` in the Workspace and the PHP-FPM Containers:
<br/>
a) open the `.env` file
<br/>
b) search for the `WORKSPACE_INSTALL_XDEBUG` argument under the Workspace settings
<br/>
c) set it to `true`
<br/>
d) search for the `PHP_FPM_INSTALL_XDEBUG` argument under the PHP-FPM settings
<br/>
e) set it to `true`

2 - Re-build the containers `docker-compose build workspace php-fpm`

For information on how to configure xDebug with your IDE and work it out, check this [Repository](https://github.com/LarryEitel/laravel-laradock-phpstorm) or follow up on the next section if you use linux and PhpStorm.

```
###########################################################
################ Containers Customization #################
###########################################################

### WORKSPACE #############################################
...
WORKSPACE_INSTALL_XDEBUG=true
...
### PHP_FPM ###############################################
...
PHP_FPM_INSTALL_XDEBUG=true
...
```



<br/>
<a name="Control-xDebug"></a>
## Start/Stop xDebug:

By installing xDebug, you are enabling it to run on startup by default.

To control the behavior of xDebug (in the `php-fpm` Container), you can run the following commands from the Laradock root folder, (at the same prompt where you run docker-compose):

- Stop xDebug from running by default: `.php-fpm/xdebug stop`.
- Start xDebug by default: `.php-fpm/xdebug start`.
- See the status: `.php-fpm/xdebug status`.

Note: If `.php-fpm/xdebug` doesn't execute and gives `Permission Denied` error the problem can be that file `xdebug` doesn't have execution access. This can be fixed by running `chmod` command with desired access permissions.

<br/>
<a name="Production"></a>






<br/>
<a name="Laradock-for-Production"></a>
## Prepare Laradock for Production

It's recommended for production to create a custom `docker-compose.yml` file, for example, `production-docker-compose.yml`

In your new production `docker-compose.yml` file, you should include only the containers you are planning to run in production (usage example: `docker-compose -f production-docker-compose.yml up -d nginx mysql redis ...`).

Note: The Database (MySQL/MariaDB/...) ports should not be forwarded on production, because Docker will automatically publish the port on the host unless specifically told not to.  Forwarding these ports on production is quite insecure - so make sure to remove these lines:

```
ports:
    - "3306:3306"
```

To learn more about how Docker publishes ports, please read [this excellent post on the subject](https://fralef.me/docker-and-iptables.html).









<br/>
<a name="Laravel"></a>






<a name="Install-Laravel"></a>
## Install Laravel from Container

1 - First you need to enter the Workspace Container.

2 - Install Laravel.

Example using Composer

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-cool-app "5.2.*"
```

> We recommend using `composer create-project` instead of the Laravel installer, to install Laravel.

For more about the Laravel installation click [here](https://laravel.com/docs/master#installing-laravel).


3 - Edit `.env` to Map the new application path:

By default, Laradock assumes the Laravel application is living in the parent directory of the laradock folder.

Since the new Laravel application is in the `my-cool-app` folder, we need to replace `../:/var/www` with `../my-cool-app/:/var/www`, as follow:

```dotenv
  APP_CODE_PATH_HOST=../my-cool-app/
```
4 - Go to that folder and start working.

```bash
cd my-cool-app
```

5 - Go back to the Laradock installation steps to see how to edit the `.env` file.






<br/>
<a name="Run-Artisan-Commands"></a>
## Run Artisan Commands

You can run artisan commands and many other Terminal commands from the Workspace container.

1 - Make sure you have the workspace container running.

```bash
docker-compose up -d workspace // ..and all your other containers
```

2 - Find the Workspace container name:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

3 - Enter the Workspace container:

```bash
docker-compose exec workspace bash
```

Note: Should add `--user=laradock` (example `docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash`) to have files created as your host's user to prevent issue owner of log file will be changed to root then laravel website cannot write on log file if using rotated log and new log file not existed


4 - Run anything you want :)

```bash
php artisan
```
```bash
composer update
```
```bash
phpunit
```
```
vue serve
```
(browse the results at `http://localhost:[WORKSPACE_VUE_CLI_SERVE_HOST_PORT]`)
```
vue ui
```
(browse the results at `http://localhost:[WORKSPACE_VUE_CLI_UI_HOST_PORT]`)




<br/>
<a name="Run-Laravel-Queue-Worker"></a>
## Run Laravel Queue Worker

1 - Create a suitable configuration file (for example named `laravel-worker.conf`) for Laravel Queue Worker in `php-worker/supervisord.d/` by simply copying from `laravel-worker.conf.example`

2 - Start everything up

```bash
docker-compose up -d php-worker
```






<br/>
<a name="Run-Laravel-Scheduler"></a>
## Run Laravel Scheduler

Laradock provides 2 ways to run Laravel Scheduler
1. Using cron in workspace container. 
Most of the time, when you start Laradock, it'll automatically start workspace container with cron inside, along with setting to run `schedule:run` command every minute.
2. Using Supervisord in php-worker to run `schedule:run`. 
This way is suggested when you don't want to start workspace in production environment.
   * Comment out cron setting in workspace container, file `workspace/crontab/laradock`
     ```bash
     # * * * * * laradock /usr/bin/php /var/www/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
      ```
   * Create a suitable configuration file (for ex., named `laravel-scheduler.conf`) for Laravel Scheduler in `php-worker/supervisord.d/` by simply copying from `laravel-scheduler.conf.example`

   * Start php-worker container
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d php-worker
     ```

Note: to add user go to `http://localhost:8090/securityRealm/addUser` and to restart it from the web app visit `http://localhost:8090/restart`.

You may wanna change the default security configuration, so go to `http://localhost:8090/configureSecurity/` under Authorization and choosing "Anyone can do anything" or "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy" or anything else.






<br/>
<a name="Use-Redis"></a>

## Use Redis

1. First make sure you run the Redis Container (`redis`) with the `docker-compose up` command.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d redis
   ```
   > To execute redis commands, enter the redis container first `docker-compose exec redis bash` then enter the `redis-cli`.

2. Open your Laravel's `.env` file and set the `REDIS_HOST` to `redis`
   ```env
   REDIS_HOST=redis
   ```
   If you're using Laravel, and you don't find the `REDIS_HOST` variable in your `.env` file. Go to the database configuration file `config/database.php` and replace the default `127.0.0.1` IP with `redis` for Redis like this:
    ```php
    'redis' => [
        'cluster' => false,
        'default' => [
            'host'     => 'redis',
            'port'     => 6379,
            'database' => 0,
        ],
    ],
    ```
3. To enable Redis Caching and/or for Sessions Management. Also from the `.env` file set `CACHE_DRIVER` and `SESSION_DRIVER` to `redis` instead of the default `file`.
   ```env
   CACHE_DRIVER=redis
   SESSION_DRIVER=redis
   ```
4. Finally make sure you have the `predis/predis` package `(~1.0)` installed via Composer:
   ```bash
   composer require predis/predis:^1.0
   ```
5. You can manually test it from Laravel with this code:
   ```php
   \Cache::store('redis')->put('Laradock', 'Awesome', 10);
   ```





<br/>
<a name="Use-Redis-Cluster"></a>
## Use Redis Cluster
1. First make sure you run the Redis-Cluster Container (`redis-cluster`) with the `docker-compose up` command.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d redis-cluster
   ```
2. Open your Laravel's `config/database.php` and set the redis cluster configuration. Below is example configuration with phpredis.
   Read the [Laravel official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/redis#configuration) for more details.
    ```php
    'redis' => [
        'client' => 'phpredis',
        'options' => [
            'cluster' => 'redis',
        ],
        'clusters' => [
            'default' => [
                [
                    'host' => 'redis-cluster',
                    'password' => null,
                    'port' => 7000,
                    'database' => 0,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
    ```

<br/>
<a name="Use-Varnish"></a>

## Use Varnish

The goal was to proxy the request to varnish server using nginx. So only nginx has been configured for Varnish proxy.
Nginx is on port 80 or 443. Nginx sends request through varnish server and varnish server sends request back to nginx on port 81 (external port is defined in `VARNISH_BACKEND_PORT`).

The idea was taken from this [post](https://www.linode.com/docs/websites/varnish/use-varnish-and-nginx-to-serve-wordpress-over-ssl-and-http-on-debian-8/)

The Varnish configuration was developed and tested for Wordpress only. Probably it works with other systems.

#### Steps to configure varnish proxy server:
1. You have to set domain name for VARNISH_PROXY1_BACKEND_HOST variable.
2. If you want to use varnish for different domains, you have to add new configuration section in your env file.
    ```
    VARNISH_PROXY1_CACHE_SIZE=128m
    VARNISH_PROXY1_BACKEND_HOST=replace_with_your_domain.name
    VARNISH_PROXY1_SERVER=SERVER1
    ```
3. Then you have to add new config section into docker-compose.yml with related variables:
    ```
    custom_proxy_name:
          container_name: custom_proxy_name
          build: ./varnish
          expose:
            - ${VARNISH_PORT}
          environment:
            - VARNISH_CONFIG=${VARNISH_CONFIG}
            - CACHE_SIZE=${VARNISH_PROXY2_CACHE_SIZE}
            - VARNISHD_PARAMS=${VARNISHD_PARAMS}
            - VARNISH_PORT=${VARNISH_PORT}
            - BACKEND_HOST=${VARNISH_PROXY2_BACKEND_HOST}
            - BACKEND_PORT=${VARNISH_BACKEND_PORT}
            - VARNISH_SERVER=${VARNISH_PROXY2_SERVER}
          ports:
            - "${VARNISH_PORT}:${VARNISH_PORT}"
          links:
            - workspace
          networks:
            - frontend
    ```
4. change your varnish config and add nginx configuration. Example Nginx configuration is here: `nginx/sites/laravel_varnish.conf.example`.
5. `varnish/default.vcl` is old varnish configuration, which was used in the previous version. Use `default_wordpress.vcl` instead.

#### How to run:
1. Rename `default_wordpress.vcl` to `default.vcl`
2. `docker-compose up -d nginx`
3. `docker-compose up -d proxy`

Keep in mind that varnish server must be built after Nginx cause varnish checks domain affordability.

#### FAQ:

1. How to purge cache? <br/>
run from any cli: <br/>`curl -X PURGE https://yourwebsite.com/`.
2. How to reload varnish?<br/>

<a name="Use-Mongo"></a>

## Use Mongo
1. First install `mongo` in the Workspace and the PHP-FPM Containers:
   * open the `.env` file
   * search for the `WORKSPACE_INSTALL_MONGO` argument under the Workspace Container
   * set it to `true`
   * search for the `PHP_FPM_INSTALL_MONGO` argument under the PHP-FPM Container
   * set it to `true`
2. Re-build the containers 
   * `docker-compose build workspace php-fpm`
3. Run the MongoDB Container (`mongo`) with the `docker-compose up` command.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d mongo
    ```
4. Add the MongoDB configurations to the `config/database.php` configuration file:
    ```php
    'connections' => [
    
        'mongodb' => [
            'driver'   => 'mongodb',
            'host'     => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
            'port'     => env('DB_PORT', 27017),
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'database'),
            'username' => '',
            'password' => '',
            'options'  => [
                'database' => '',
            ]
        ],
    
    	// ...
    
    ],
    ```

5 - Open your Laravel's `.env` file and update the following variables:

- set the `DB_HOST` to your `mongo`.
- set the `DB_PORT` to `27017`.
- set the `DB_DATABASE` to `database`.


6 - Finally make sure you have the `jenssegers/mongodb` package installed via Composer and its Service Provider is added.

```bash

nginx:
  build:
    context: ./nginx
    args:
      - PHP_UPSTREAM_CONTAINER=${NGINX_PHP_UPSTREAM_CONTAINER}
      - PHP_UPSTREAM_PORT=${NGINX_PHP_UPSTREAM_PORT}
      - CHANGE_SOURCE=${CHANGE_SOURCE}
  volumes:
    - ${APP_CODE_PATH_HOST}:${APP_CODE_PATH_CONTAINER}
    - ${NGINX_HOST_LOG_PATH}:/var/log/nginx
    - ${NGINX_SITES_PATH}:/etc/nginx/sites-available
  depends_on:
    - php-fpm
  networks:
    - frontend
    - backend
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.http.services.nginx.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
    # https router
    - "traefik.http.routers.https.rule=Host(`${ACME_DOMAIN}`, `www.${ACME_DOMAIN}`)"
    - "traefik.http.routers.https.entrypoints=https"
    - "traefik.http.routers.https.middlewares=www-redirectregex"
    - "traefik.http.routers.https.service=nginx"
    - "traefik.http.routers.https.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
    # http router
    - "traefik.http.routers.http.rule=Host(`${ACME_DOMAIN}`, `www.${ACME_DOMAIN}`)"
    - "traefik.http.routers.http.entrypoints=http"
    - "traefik.http.routers.http.middlewares=http-redirectscheme"
    - "traefik.http.routers.http.service=nginx"
    # middlewares
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.www-redirectregex.redirectregex.permanent=true"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.www-redirectregex.redirectregex.regex=^https://www.(.*)"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.www-redirectregex.redirectregex.replacement=https://$$1"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.http-redirectscheme.redirectscheme.permanent=true"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.http-redirectscheme.redirectscheme.scheme=https"
```

To change the timezone for the `workspace` container, modify the `TZ` build argument in the Docker Compose file to one in the [TZ database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

For example, if I want the timezone to be `New York`:

```yml
    workspace:
        build:
            context: ./workspace
            args:
                - TZ=America/New_York

# Custom cron
* * * * * root echo "Every Minute" > /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

Make sure you [change the timezone](#Change-the-timezone) if you don't want to use the default (UTC).

If you are on Windows, verify that the line endings for this file are LF only, otherwise the cron jobs will silently fail.






<br/>
<a name="Workspace-ssh"></a>
## Access workspace via ssh

You can access the `workspace` container through `localhost:2222` by setting the `INSTALL_WORKSPACE_SSH` build argument to `true`.

Modify the `mysql/my.cnf` file to set your port number, `1234` is used as an example.

```
[mysqld]
port=1234
```

If you need <a href="#MySQL-access-from-host">MySQL access from your host</a>, do not forget to change the internal port number (`"3306:3306"` -> `"3306:1234"`) in the docker-compose configuration file.

<a name="Use-custom-Domain"></a>
## Use custom Domain

> How to use a custom domain, instead of the Docker IP.

Assuming your custom domain is `laravel.test`

1 - Open your `/etc/hosts` file and map your localhost address `127.0.0.1` to the `laravel.test` domain, by adding the following:

```bash
127.0.0.1    laravel.test
```

2 - Open your browser and visit `{http://laravel.test}`


Optionally you can define the server name in the NGINX configuration file, like this:

```conf
server_name laravel.test;
```

<a name="Install-PNPM"></a>
## Install PNPM

pnpm uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk. When using npm or Yarn for example, if you have 100 projects using the same version of lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk. With pnpm, lodash will be saved in a single place on the disk and a hard link will put it into the node_modules where it should be installed.

As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations! If you'd like more details about the unique node_modules structure that pnpm creates and why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem.

<a name="Speed-MacOS"></a>
## Improve speed on MacOS

Docker on the Mac [is slow](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77), at the time of writing. Especially for larger projects, this can be a problem. The problem is [older than March 2016](https://forums.docker.com/t/file-access-in-mounted-volumes-extremely-slow-cpu-bound/8076) - as it's a such a long-running issue, we're including it in the docs here.

So since sharing code into Docker containers with osxfs have very poor performance compared to Linux. Likely there are some workarounds:



### Workaround A: using dinghy

[Dinghy](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy) creates its own VM using docker-machine, it will not modify your existing docker-machine VMs.

Quick Setup giude, (we recommend you check their docs)

1) `brew tap codekitchen/dinghy`

2) `brew install dinghy`

3) `dinghy create --provider virtualbox` (must have virtualbox installed, but they support other providers if you prefer)

4) after the above command is done it will display some env variables, copy them to the bash profile or zsh or.. (this will instruct docker to use the server running inside the VM)

5) `docker-compose up ...`






<br/>
<a name="Docker-Sync"></a>
### Workaround B: using d4m-nfs

You can use the d4m-nfs solution in 2 ways, the first is by using the built-in Laradock integration, and the second is using the tool separately. Below is show case of both methods:


### B.1: using the built in d4m-nfs integration

In simple terms, docker-sync creates a docker container with a copy of all the application files that can be accessed very quickly from the other containers.
On the other hand, docker-sync runs a process on the host machine that continuously tracks and updates files changes from the host to this intermediate container.

Out of the box, it comes pre-configured for OS X, but using it on Windows is very easy to set-up by modifying the `DOCKER_SYNC_STRATEGY` on the `.env`

#### Usage

Laradock comes with `sync.sh`, an optional bash script, that automates installing, running and stopping docker-sync.  Note that to run the bash script you may need to change the permissions `chmod 755 sync.sh`

1) Configure your Laradock environment as you would normally do and test your application to make sure that your sites are running correctly.

2) Make sure to set `DOCKER_SYNC_STRATEGY` on the `.env`. Read the [syncing strategies](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/8.-Strategies) for details.
```
# osx: 'native_osx' (default)
# windows: 'unison'
# linux: docker-sync not required

DOCKER_SYNC_STRATEGY=native_osx
```

3) set `APP_CODE_CONTAINER_FLAG` to `APP_CODE_CONTAINER_FLAG=:nocopy` in the .env file

4) Install the docker-sync gem on the host-machine:
```bash
./sync.sh install
```
5) Start docker-sync and the Laradock environment.
Specify the services you want to run, as you would normally do with `docker-compose up`
```bash
./sync.sh up nginx mysql
```
Please note that the first time docker-sync runs, it will copy all the files to the intermediate container and that may take a very long time (15min+).
6) To stop the environment and docker-sync do:
```bash
./sync.sh down
```

#### Setting up Aliases (optional)

You may create bash profile aliases to avoid having to remember and type these commands for everyday development.
Add the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
alias devup="cd /PATH_TO_LARADOCK/laradock; ./sync.sh up nginx mysql" #add your services
alias devbash="cd /PATH_TO_LARADOCK/laradock; ./sync.sh bash"
alias devdown="cd /PATH_TO_LARADOCK/laradock; ./sync.sh down"
```

Now from any location on your machine, you can simply run `devup`, `devbash` and `devdown`.


#### Additional Commands

Opening bash on the workspace container (to run artisan for example):
 ```bash
 ./sync.sh bash
 ```
Manually triggering the synchronization of the files:
```bash
./sync.sh sync
```
Removing and cleaning up the files and the docker-sync container. Use only if you want to rebuild or remove docker-sync completely. The files on the host will be kept untouched.
```bash
./sync.sh clean
```


#### Additional Notes

- You may run laradock with or without docker-sync at any time using with the same `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`, because the configuration is overridden automatically when docker-sync is used.
- You may inspect the `sync.sh` script to learn each of the commands and even add custom ones.
- If a container cannot access the files on docker-sync, you may need to set a user on the Dockerfile of that container with an id of 1000 (this is the UID that nginx and php-fpm have configured on laradock). Alternatively, you may change the permissions to 777, but this is **not** recommended.

Visit the [docker-sync documentation](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki) for more details.






<br/>

### B.2: using the d4m-nfs tool

[D4m-nfs](https://github.com/IFSight/d4m-nfs) automatically mount NFS volume instead of osxfs one.

1) Update the Docker [File Sharing] preferences:

Click on the Docker Icon > Preferences > (remove everything form the list except `/tmp`).

2) Restart Docker.

3) Clone the [d4m-nfs](https://github.com/IFSight/d4m-nfs) repository to your `home` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IFSight/d4m-nfs ~/d4m-nfs
```

4) Create (or edit) the file `~/d4m-nfs/etc/d4m-nfs-mounts.txt`, and write the following configuration in it:

```txt
/Users:/Users
```

5) Create (or edit) the file `/etc/exports`, make sure it exists and is empty. (There may be collisions if you come from Vagrant or if you already executed the `d4m-nfs.sh` script before).


6) Run the `d4m-nfs.sh` script (might need Sudo):

```bash
~/d4m-nfs/d4m-nfs.sh
```

That's it! Run your containers.. Example:

```bash
docker-compose up ...
```

*Note: If you faced any errors, try restarting Docker, and make sure you have no spaces in the `d4m-nfs-mounts.txt` file, and your `/etc/exports` file is clear.*

<a name="ca-certificates"></a>
## ca-certificates

To install your own CA certificates, you can add them to the `workspace/ca-certificates` folder.
This way the certificates will be installed into the system ca store of the workspace container.


<br/>
<a name="upgrade-laradock"></a>
## Upgrade Laradock

Moving from Docker Toolbox (VirtualBox) to Docker Native (for Mac/Windows). Requires upgrading Laradock from v3.* to v4.*:

1. Stop the docker VM `docker-machine stop {default}`
2. Install Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
3. Upgrade Laradock to `v4.*.*` (`git pull origin master`)
4. Use Laradock as you used to do: `docker-compose up -d nginx mysql`.

**Note:** If you face any problem with the last step above: rebuild all your containers
`docker-compose build --no-cache`
"Warning Containers Data might be lost!"
